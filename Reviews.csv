They also taste a bit milky, but there are no milk products listed, which just makes the flavor even stranger.  They don't have that crusted on goodness of the tin ones.  However, my 6 year old really likes them and, while I don't have a container to compare, I'm thinking that the lack of crusty goodness *might* make these a somewhat healthier choice for her.

Non-stop diarrhea was the worst part of it.  Aside from these treats, nothing else in her diet was different than usual.  Her appetite is still not back to normal, and it's been a month now.  She's listless and just doesn't seem like herself yet, though the GI issues are OK now.<br /><br />I wanted to warn people that these treats are irradiated, since the listing here on Amazon doesn't indicate it.  There's a seal on the back of the package stating, ""Treated with radiation for your safety"".  Since a number of foods are irradiated for human and pet consumption and thought to be safe, I'm not sure if unsafe levels of radiation was the issue in our case, or if it was simple food poisoning.<br /><br />Either way, I wish I'd known the treats were irradiated before I bought them, especially since the irradiated Orijen cat food imported to Australia in 2008 ended up being the cause of death and illness for many cats.

In my case, I ordered these from Bulgaricus and also grains from Lifetime Kefir. I am a fan of both grains, though they produce kefir differing in flavor and consistency.<br /><br />The  Bulgaricus grains arrive in relatively large quantities, allowing one to consume the kefir produced after only one ""healing / restoration"" batch.  The grains are relatively thick in diameter--allowing even courses mesh strainers to be used without worry of too many grains passing through. The kefir produced is rather creamy and fairly viscous.<br /><br />Lifetime Kefir arrives in a very small quantity, and it takes about a week to set up.  The grains themselves are extremely tiny, and even after a month or so of cultivation, the individual grains remain small in diameter. The kefir produced by Lifetime Kefir is stronger in taste (acidity) and somewhat less viscous when compared to Bulgaricus.<br /><br />Another reviewer here was complaining about the curds being thick and (perhaps) overly grainy.  The  Bulgaricus kefir curd does separate substantially from the whey.  I like this, as it allows me to remove the milk serum prior to pushing the curds through the strainer, and thereby to effect a thicker, more yoghurt-like kefir.  Leaving the whey in and re-mixing it with the curds, will yield a thinner kefir drink if that is what you are after.  By contrast, I find it harder to get thicker kefir from the Lifetime Kefir grains when I want it, so I appreciate having both varieties around to process in different ways.<br /><br />In the end I find the Bulgaricus kefir to be a fine strain!"

The fact that it contains phyto-estrogens just complicates things further if you're concerned about testosterone levels. But sometimes things that look a bit crazy seem to work out well in unexpected ways.<br /><br />I started using fenugreek a year ago, discontinued it because of the testosterone concerns, and recently restarted it to help moderate anxiety symptoms from a choline-related medication I had just started. Since fenugreek's action appears analogous in many ways to oxytocin (a hormone closely related to empathy and the mitigation of fear/anxiety responses), I thought it might help to defuse these reactions. It was at least worth a shot.<br /><br />It does seem to have helped with the anxiety reactions (I combined it with l-glutamine for those who are really interested). What surprised me completely was the very strong boost in libido that I experienced inside of three days. And when I went back and doublechecked the research on fenugreek, I found that a mid-2011 report by Australian researchers showed a 25 percent increase in male libido for those using fenugreek. So objective research says this effect of fenugreek is real. Subjectively, I know that this supplement is way more effective for me than things like saw palmetto that are commonly marketed for libido boosts.<br /><br />And I wasn't even looking for this effect. But it works, and this is one of those side-effects that's a keeper. Beyond this, fenugreek is commonly used around the world by both sexes to help with type 2 diabetes. It appears to help with blood-sugar levels, but I can't say definitively that it works. It's inexpensive enough to be worth trying.<br /><br />My hoped-for long-term use for fenugreek is actually to help with what Buddhists call metta meditation, that is, focusing on lovingkindness. Research by the Center for Affective Neuroscience at the University of Wisconsin suggests that expert meditators on lovingkindness modulate the functioning of the amygdala, a component of the brain that helps to establish empathic reactions and, once again, is closely associated with oxytocin. My experience so far is that fenugreek does in fact help with empathy. This makes eminent sense. Lactation and mother-child bonding pretty much go hand in hand.<br /><br />If you're interested in the underlying neurophysiology, you can probably do a much better job than me in researching this. If you're just a guy who could use a shot in the arm for lovemaking, then this is a worthwhile supplement even if we can't figure out all the physiology involved. Even if none of the above effects interests you, fenugreek is used for and may help with many other things, such as digestion (see Wikipedia for more information on such uses).<br /><br />I hope some of this proves helpful."

My only caution is do not fall for some hype or scare tactic that recommends some unproven or untested food or some fad diet for your pet. Don't listen to me, don't listen to the negative review. ASK YOUR VET what they recommend, and follow their instructions. My guess is you'll end up buying the Science Diet anyhow."

The first night, I filled 3 gel capsules with the tincture and went to bed and felt NO EFFECTS WHATSOEVER!  If anything, I remembered less dreams than I usually do on any given night and had more disturbed sleep.  I had read another review about this herb requiring more of it to perhaps experience lucid dreaming... Emboldened by the fact that I wasn't allergic to it, I measured out 20ml and this time drank an over the counter sleep drink that contained melatonin with it and went to bed after 45 minutes... Nothing. Again. Waking up in the middle of the night over and over again with no dream recall which is LESS than my day to day.<br /><br />So, I figured that maybe it has a reverse tolerance...So the third night, I took 30ml on a mostly empty stomach...By now, the taste didn't bother me as I have been used to tinctures before and this is by far not the worst. I had noticed some muscle soreness the nights before and started to get some of this this night as well...Still, no dream recall; and this coming from someone who recalls a dream daily.  Some sleep disturbance but not tired because of it...So much for third time's the charm...<br /><br />I waited for a few days and figured one last go around; a fourth time...I had dreams that I recalled on the days without it in between the third time and the fourth time...I tried 30ml again and on mostly an empty stomach...Not only no dream recall but woke up earlier than I normally do...I don't feel overly tired from waking but certainly no dream recall, much less any lucid dreaming...<br /><br />This may work for some folks, but at price over $30, with no return policy and the bottle more than half gone, I am disappointed thoroughly.

It is fairly convenient to make, and I found the flavor to be very authentic.  I have been eating at Vietnamese restaurants for a long time, and the flavor of the soup is right up there with some of my favorite places.  Having tried my hand at recreating the flavor at home, I can assure you that the soup packet is much easier.  Yes, you do need to add your own meat and vegetables, but would you want that stuff to come out of the box?  I've been using chicken broth and chicken (note that the meat option says to use beef).  I also recommend adding a thinly sliced onion to the broth when you start to get that authentic flavor.<br /><br />This is the perfect product if you have celiac, as it is gluten free and you can control what goes into it."

I wouldn't let the kids run around school or the mall puffing on these, but they are fun and a good chew as well!

YUM!  Every kids dream, right?<br /><br />Well each  time I consumed some of these brightly colored cereals or pastries or drinks or candies, over the next few hours I would develop at least mild stomach pain. The deeper the color or the more I consumed, the worse the experience. Eventually it ended with me locked in the bathroom, doubled over in pain, for hours on end, as perplexed school officials called my parents to come get me, as I was AGAIN being sent home from school.  I was soo embarrassed. Pity the few subs who refused me a hall pass - I remember vomiting at my desk more than a few times to the stunned sub who hadn't realized how seriously I had GI issues. If I say I need a hall pass, I meant I *needed* a pass.<br /><br />Growing up as a teenager, dad remarried and my stepmother didn't buy much colorful ""kids"" drinks n such anymore. Wow, what a change, I even managed a year of perfect attendance! Me?! The kid who averaged 20+ days out sick from school had perfect attendance! My grades improved! I felt better....<br /><br />Then as a young adult, I was trying to kick the soda bucket and went back to the colorful sugary drinks of my youth. The abdominal pain and diarrhea was unreal. I began missing some college classes and my grades slipped. I was having some difficulty at work with a male boss who did not understand, he even implied I was lazy. Really? I was going to college full-time while working in a factory with forced overtime and tutoring on the side. It wasn't my fault I had a sensitive stomach....<br /><br />...until one day I was at home with one of the really bad episodes, doubled over in pain with diarrhea again and it suddenly hit upon me. GRAPE KOOL-AID.  I had consumed a whole pitcher of GRAPE KOOL-AID that day before getting ready for work (2nd shift). I read through the label... RED 40 and BLUE 1 stuck out...  so I stooped drinking grape Kool-Aid and went back to Pepsi for awhile. Symptoms stabilized... until one day when I had a tuna lunchable. A small attack convinced me to read labels- there was BLUE 1 again.<br /><br />I was 25 years old when I made the ""BLUE 1 DISCOVERY"". I am now in my 40s. I have since learned to avoid lotions, mouthwash, dish soap, GRAPE KOOLAID and even ""white marshmallows"".  Since learning to avoid BLUE 1 including GRAPE KOOL-AID my life has significantly improved.<br /><br />I discovered very serious and relevant information about BLUE 1 from the FDA website... the term ""BLUE 1"" and ""causally linked to fatalities"" was significant enough for me that I wrote to the medical doctor who issued the press release; we shared a number of interesting email exchanges.<br /><br />I  have learned some ""natural"" brands of ""children's cereals"" are made with elderberry juice for coloring. I wish KOOL-AID would change to natural colors! (If using colors at all...) Oh and I kicked the soda bucket, too. I learned what fresh squeezed lemons mixed in a glass of water with d-ribose could do for both taste AND for energy. I feel so much better!"

244507,B0030VBQ5Y,A1LXBIDWACC4TS,"J. Friedman ""JF""",0,0,5,1339027200,"Great for kids, perfect for travel, what's not to like?","This is for HappyBaby Happy Tot fruit pouches. These are excellent for kids. My 2 year old loves it. She asks for it every morning and everytime she takes a bath. It's great - totally organic with all natural ingredients and no harmful chemicals, GMO's or preservatives! It does not need to be refridgerated so wont take up space in your fridge (although once it's opened it does, as do most products). It's great for kids at least half a year old and is recommended by the well known Dr. Sears, TV personality, author, and acclaimed professor at UC Irvine.<br /><br />The container is well made and does not flap around. It can stand up on its own as it has a base that is round and designed to stand up - other containers will lay flat and leak out when the child puts the pouch down. It also has a brighly colored plastic cap that, before opening for the first time, cannot be removed by a small child. You will need to open it for them. The cap is large enough that small 2 year old hands can manipulate it open and closed without much difficulty. The cap is also color coded to match the packaging design, so you can easily and quickly identify which one you want. Likewise, the packaging is colorful and well designed. It shows pictures of the fruit on the side and writing for the adults so you can choose your variety.<br /><br />The fruit variety is tasty. I have sampled some of it and found it to be pretty good for smoothies and adult meals! Regardless, it's a child's drink, so the focus is on how much the children enjoy it. I find that no child has objected to the flavor, although some flavors certainly get unique - who would want to eat broccoli and pear together? Butternut squash and apple is certainly a savory combination. Spinach and mango? Doesnt matter. My kids love all flavors. Sure, some have preferences, but these are great combinations and are supremely healthy.<br /><br />Speaking of which, I had no clue what Salba was, so I googled it.[...] Evidently it's a SUPER healthy grain that is an excellent source of Omega 3's, fiber, magnesium, calcium, antioxidants, folate, and dietary fiber. Evidently it's also better than Chia and Flax seeds as well. This all comes from the Salba website so it's obviously to be taken with a grain (no pun intended!) of salt, but still, that sounds fantastic to me. Surely this cant hurt a growing child's system!<br /><br />While other reviewers have noted that this product is available for cheaper at Target for $1.09 per pouch. I have not been to the Target store lately so I cannot verify that, but I did a price comparison on Target's online website.  [...]) Again, I did not go into the store - you might be able to find this in the store for cheaper. As of 6/7/12, the cheapest pack was $10.16 cents for Spinach, Mango and Pear, and Broccoli, Pear and Peas, or $20.32 for 16 of them. In my state, we have 6% sales tax ($1.22), which turns that total into $21.54 for a 16 pack, or $1.34 per drink. Compare that to Amazon's price, which is $19.20 (no sales tax) for SMP and $19.86 for BPP. You can also sign up with subscribe and save, which will yield a 15% discount, or a total of $16.32 for SMP, or $16.88 for BPP. That's a savings of $3.44 to $4 total, or over a quarter for each item. Green Beans, Pears and Peas sells for $19.52 or $16.59 for S&S on Amazon, vs. $24.25 at Target (online pricing, but I added sales tax), which is a $7.66 price difference! Again, these are NOT in-store prices, just online prices.<br /><br />You should be aware that there is a recall on some HappyBaby pouches. Pay attention to those expiring between November 2010 and January 2011. The press release indicates that nobody has been hurt and no harmful bacterias have been found. (http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm197570.htm). In fact, one of my pouches started swelling up, so I threw it out, but my daughter enjoyed the rest of the pouches from that batch (I sampled them to be sure) and was fine. I just assumed it was a bad pouch but now I know that there's a recall, so I will be keeping an eye out, as you should. Does not mean you should give these up - there have not been any harmful effects and it appears to be a bad batch which the company has corrected."

So I purchased it, I have two small dogs a seven year old Yorkie and a seven month old puppy Bichon Frise/ Toy Poodle mix. Well I showed it to the puppy I got the liver flavor it does smell bad and let him sniff it he went wild and starting jumping towards my hand trying to get it and barking like crazy I told him sit and paw and he did  and I give him a lick he loved it. Now my Yorkie sniffed it and walked away but she is extremely picky about her treats so it did not surprise me at all. I love how this is small can fit in a jacket and is about the length of your hand opened, this is low in calories 1 calorie in 10 licks and the bottle has 500 licks! this is great I clicker train my puppy and he knows a bunch of tricks but I always felt Like I was filling him up with a ton of treats and then would have to feed him less dinner and I felt bad. But with this I no longer have to worry now it can be messy if your not careful don't squeeze too hard, I will definitely be getting more of this and trying it in different flavors for my Pup Mozart. This is also great for teaching small dogs to heel to stay by your left side and it is great to use outside when the puppy gets distracted by people or other dogs kids etc I can refocus his attention on me and get him to calm down."

I bought this based on the reviews and it was the stalest, most bitter whole bean coffee I've ever used.  One of the canisters was open on arrival but there was literally no difference between the aromas of the sealed cans and the open can.  What does that say about the freshness of the sealed cans?  You can seal it tight as a drum but if the coffee sat around and got stale before it was canned then all the vacuum in the world won't help it.  Then I couldn't get that stale aroma/flavor out of my grinder without thoroughly cleaning it.  I don't know what you guys are used to drinking but this isn't worth 1/4 of the price regardless of how much it costs.  If you think this is 5 stars then check out RONA, which Amazon carries.  Their Jamaican Blue Mountain Peaberry is without peer.  Compare their Kenya AA Superior Peaberry to this swill and you will know what premium coffee is supposed to taste like.

I ended up making nachos the next day with some of the leftover taco beef I had and added the sauce to the mix before I cooked them.  I did not like the way they came out.  This sauce is definitely better as an add on rather than something to cook with.<br /><br />It's an Ok sauce (hence my star rating) but I won't be using this as my regular taco sauce as I still prefer the red typical sauce I had been using.

My dogs are pretty small- Romeo is about 11 pounds and Juliet is roughly 9 pounds. They used to be given these mini ones, but because they are pretty aggressive chewers- I now give them the medium version after some trial and error, as these mini ones were devoured too quickly. These treats aren't super soft- but they are relatively soft when compared to other, harder dental treats we have tried. These have a really similar texture to the Greenies brand, but we like these ones much better than the Greenies. These treats smell pretty gross to me, but my pups love them. I like the smell of the Extra Fresh ones- they really smell like parsley and eucalyptus oil, which both can be found on the ingredient list of that flavor. I like that these are gluten free. I like that they have added vitamins and omegas. These ones are okay nutritionally for a treat, and the chewing action is always a good thing, but I like that the other flavor has actual ingredients that are good for dental health. Most importantly, my dogs love the taste of both of the treats. I buy these ones rarely, as I much prefer the other flavor, but these are still good treats. The only negatives I have are that these are really pricey, and they are devoured quite quickly, even by my dogs who are 12 years old and missing nearly half of their teeth.

It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea.

One serving--13 chips or 1 oz.--provides one daily serving of vegetables.  Wow!  They have a bit of a sweet potato/carrot-salty taste although they're fairly low in sodium (only 6% of daily allowance.)  They have a bubbly light texture which is fun. Love the texture. They have no trans-fat and are all natural and cholesterol free and vegan.  The fat content is 11% which is okay--it's from pressed sunflower and canola oils.<br /><br />I love the taste of them--especially knowing they provide a serving of vegetables.  Other ingredients include dried potatoes, navy beans, rice flour, potato starch, carrot, sweet potato, maltodextrin, onion powder, garlic powder, konjac flour, citric acid and natural flavor.  They are a fun sorta crescent shape.

The shipping costs were high, to me, but it did insure fast arrival. I bought another item at the same time i am still waiting for.(week longer so far) So, if the need for a quick malted drink is moving you, this did its best to quench that urge.<br />I have used it in various things as i had done with my malt additives in the past.  i used it with the homemade yogurt I now use instead of the hand packed french vanilla for my shakes people now call smoothies. I used it to add to the flavor of a cheesecake i make (coconut/malt, standard vanilla/malt,etc) It most definitely helped the cheesecakes and the shakes benefited as well.<br />My only issue, and not a complaint really, is the flavor isnt what i was looking for. It has its own flavor, for sure and i didnt need a ton of it for the presence to be noticed. I found the flavor pleasant enough and the fact that it was instant helped too.  I started using the malted milkshake flavors a long time ago and i didnt know of any retail instant types. some had to be 'melted' like or made into a syrup with hot water before i could successfully make them fully disperse into my shakes. that was 50yrs ago and i worked at a place where we made malted milks/shakes and the product was not the same as what i could get from the normal retail store. That is the flavor i am looking for, just the malt, none of the other flavors, vanilla or whatever sweeteners that is added to the mixes.  i can not detract from this product because it is good, easy to use and about the same price as the  big name brand, a bit more maybe.

It is so deliciously thick and complex, you can use it for anything as everyone already said - in any context where the taste of balsamic can shine.  It is as delightful on insalate Capresa as it is drizzled on your best salad, or used for bruschetta, or even used to (sparingly) top vanilla ice cream (knock your guests socks off with this one; for the adventurous, add some fresh cracked black pepper as well).<br />Honestly, for around $44. on Amazon (which is good, our local gourmet stores that carry it ask for at least $50) with free shipping - it is a STEAL.

For at least 4 years I have been using the Green Mountain Columbian Fair Trade K-cups, been very happy with them. Recently I saw the Donut House flavor offered at my local warehouse club and it piqued my interest, problem is that the warehouse box contains 80 K-cups, didn't want to buy 80 of something I may not like. So, I picked up an 18-count box at my local Walmart, I'm so glad that I did!<br /><br />First, let me say that I'm not a fan of Starbucks coffee's, I think they are too strong, too bold, too bitter. I like a flavorful, medium roast but full-bodied cup of coffee. The Green Mountain Columbian Fair Trade K-cups fit this bill, whenever I would make a cup at my office, everyone would comment, ""Wow, that smells so good!"", it tasted just as good.<br /><br />I tried the Donut House coffee this morning, no inviting aroma when brewing, very bland in taste, I don't know how they get away with calling this ""Bold"". It says right on the box, ""light roast"", I don't know how a ""light roast"" can be called ""Bold""? I was expecting a very full-bodied flavor, but without a bitter after-taste. Well, there was no after-taste, no taste period, just very bland!<br /><br />FYI, I usually use 16 oz. ""to go"" cups when brewing K-cups, I use 2 K-cups per 16 oz. cup, I brew the first K-cup on the middle button (8 oz. setting), the the second K-cup on the lowest setting (I think it is 6.5 oz. setting), this allows room for a teaspoon of sugar and some half and half to a golden color. I have been doing this for years with my Columbian K-cups and always get a great cup of coffee, did the same with the Donut House blend, drinkable, but not remarkable in any way. I will be sticking with my Columbian Fair Trade blend that never fails me.<br /><br />I will use the remainder of my Donut House K-cups, but I will not buy them again."

I will continue with Kitchens of India, however, as they do have some tasty dishes."

Lemen,8,37,1,1312329600,Waste of my money.,"The Nutiva coconut oil was not moisturizing, which wasn't a surprise since oil doesn't moisturize, it just coats whatever you put it on. As such, once you moisturize your skin then apply coconut oil, this can help slow down the evaporation of the moisture into the air. That is great if you are less than 30 years old.  At 50+ I actually want and need moisture. I used this product faithfully for 6 weeks and all it did was smooth my legs for about an hour and then they were parched and dried looking again because I hadn't actually added moisture. My legs also felt greasy and had a faint odor of coconut. I don't really want a 2-step process of using a moisturizer on my legs then coating them with coconut oil.  As a face moisturizer it just made my face break out (yuuuuck!). As for the taste, I'll just say that butter has nothing to fear from this stuff. I really can't believe I fell for the hype and wasted my money with this purchase."

Even the description had me sold however it just didn't live up to the hype.<br /><br />Since I didn't have a pod brewer, I originally tried brewing this coffee in a standard coffee maker which came out super weak even though I used 3 pods. Then I tried squeezing each of the pods into my coffee cup which made it a tad better but still weak. I drank this coffee black which I rarely do but any creamer would have just ruined it.<br /><br />I also tried brewing it like a tea which just didn't work at all. Eventually I found a pod machine and it was weak just using one pod. After using about 7 pods to try out this coffee and get a desired result, I just gave up. I couldn't get the desired quality and as for taste, it's equivalent to something you'll find in McDonalds. I didn't get a hint of anything else."
